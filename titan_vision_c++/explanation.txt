This folder contains the C++ version of Titan's OSD.

The intent of doing this in C++ is to reduce the overhead and processing needed for the OSD to operate. Leading to:
- Higher OSD update rates
- Higher video framerates allowed
- Higher resolution video without sacrificing framerate
- More resources/space for other features to be added in the future
